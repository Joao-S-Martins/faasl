Every year, we like to pre-party the season of Lent by indlging in sugared mountains of filhoes, a.k.a. Portuguese Donuts. These things go super-fast, so it is highly recommended that you pre-order ASAP. Pick-up on Tuesday morning.

They are $1 a piece and are often ordered by the dozen. Take a batch to work and you'll be voted "most popular" for a month or two. Or just horde them at home and build a sugar-coated fort, to hide from the world. Either way, you win! #faaslfilhoes

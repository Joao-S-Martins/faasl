It's time for classic carols on cold winter nights.

Our musicians will be gathering in surprise locations Friday and Saturday, the 4th and 5th of December. The rumor is that we'll be somewhere near restaurants in Hayward on Friday and somewhere near a San Leandro shopping center on Saturday, before our membership dinner.

This is a fun, casual, and optional gig for our musicians who enjoy surprising crowds with a little Christmas music. Uniforms will be left at home, but remember to dress warmly.

Keep you eyes on our Facebook page for last-minute updates and announcements.

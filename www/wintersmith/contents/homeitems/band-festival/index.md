This November 5th is the 13th annual festival of the Portuguese-founded marching bands of California. It's being hosted in Artesia by the [Filarmonica do Artesia DES](https://www.facebook.com/events/886198148163277/, "Facebook event details for the 13th Annual Portuguese Band Festival"). It's a full day of music followed by a night of dancing.

We have bus seats and rooms available for anybody who wants to attend the festival. Our bus rides are always fun, and this is the easiest way to get your yearly dose of the filarmonica extravaganza.

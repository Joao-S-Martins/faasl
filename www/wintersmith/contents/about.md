####About the FAASL

The Filarmonica Artista Amadora was created in 1980 by mostly Portuguese imigrants.
They met to rehears and provide music for mostly traditional festivals throughout the bay.
Today, we still perform for many traditional festivals throughout norther California.
We've expanded into providing musical instruction for people of all ages and welcome musicians of all ages and skill levels to join our rehearsals and perform with us.

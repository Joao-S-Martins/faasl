# A New Budgeting Model
## What
A form of budgeting where we create and monitor special funds in addition to the general fund. We then set goals for these funds that are based on our regular expenditures in those areas, our current growth, and other expeditures that we hope to make. The board will pledge a certain amount from the general fund to each special fund and put it to our member base and corporate donors to raise the rest of the funding.
## Why
## How
### Fund Ideas
These are just my initial thoughts.
I don't want there to be too many funds because it getss confusing and it's unneccissary.
I think 3 funds plus the general fund are the maximum funds, but 2 is ideal.
#### Instruments
Update and maintain our inventory of instruments and supplies.
This will allow us to buy instruments when we need them instead of prioritizing their purchase last.
#### Uniforms
Keep an inventory of uniforms that are in great condition.
This will keep us better prepared for when we suddenly gain musicians as well us when our young musicians grow.
#### "Special"
This is a fund that takes money for the occasional special project or even, such as hosting festival, traveling to Portugal, recording an album, or traveling to distant band festivals.
The expediture goals and their priorities will need to be especially clear here because these goals are often require multi-year funding.
#### Building
This fund seems excessive to me.
The idea is to have a fund that targets our building maintencance and improvements.
This is the kind of thing that normally belongs in the general fund, but we have such a long list of backlogged building needs that we might want a fund setup for them.
#### General
This isn't really a new fund and we don't need to set a goal for it our ask for special donations to it.
But we do need an idea of what this fund will be responsible for because people will ask.

Money will be pledged from this fund in to other funds at the board's discrecion.
This fund will be responsible for stocking the bar, hosting fundraisers, and communicating to our members.
This fund is also where the donations gained by the bar, our fundraisers, and membership dues end up.
Any other expense that isn't part of another fund and every donation that isn't specified to a fund will be part of the general fund.

### Sharing Success

## When
The funds need to be defined asap, with goals set in October or November and our first announced with a soft launch at our members appreciation dinner in December. It then needs to be included in our first-quarter mailers and added to our membership renewal forms. It needs to be be announced again at our anniversary with a few FAQs publicly answered. The website needs to be updated before the first-quater mailers and social web properties can be updated slightly afterwards.

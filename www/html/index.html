        <p class="col-xs-12 animate slide-up">Our group was founded in 1980 by amateur musicians who wanted to enrich their community through music. Over 35 years later, <em>our goal remains the same</em>. We remain committed to impacting lives through music education and mentorship opportunities. We firmly believe in supporting musicians of all walks and stages of life. A love for music bonds us all and we want to share it with you.</p>

          Officially the <em>Filarmonica Artista Amadora de San Leandro</em>, our name translates to the <em>Band of Amateur Artists of San Leandro</em>.

        <p class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-sm-pull-6 animate slide-right">Our founders were mostly Portuguese immigrants with varying musical experience; some with no experience at all. They pooled their knowledge and resources to help each other and create this band. Today, our all-volunteer organization has grown into a heterogeneous group representing many different social classes and backgrounds. We each pool our abilities to invest in each other and elevate our lives.</p>

        <p class="col-xs-12 col-md-6 animate slide-up">A community has to make a priority of providing for its future generations. We do this with our <em>free</em> beginner and intermediate programs. All lessons are taught in a group setting, with all the same amenities of our volunteer band. The beginner class introduces new musicians, aged 8+, to their instruments and written music starting each February. The intermediate class is a transitional program whereby students rehearse and perform with our volunteer band, but also have a separate weekly lesson to focus on excerpts and musical theory.
        </p>
        <ul class="col-xs-11 col-xs-offset-1 col-md-5">
          <p>In our programs, students learn:</p>
          <li>How to play and maintain their instruments</li>
          <li>How to read music and keep time</li>
          <li>Common scales, musical keys, and notations</li>

        <p class="col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-pull-6 animate slide-up">A community must nourish its core. For us, this is our volunteer band. This mixed-age group of new and experienced musicians are dedicated to improving one another as much as improving themselves. Younger musicians play along side older musicians, learning in a manor that simply can't be replicated in a peer-aged group. Experienced musicians take pride in helping a future generation of musicians while expanding on their own skills with a challenging and changing repertoire.

        <p class="col-xs-12 col-md-6 animate slide-up">A community thrives when it shares its talents with others. We work with our contacts in neighbouring communities to maintain a robust performance schedule that takes us around the <abbr title="San Francisco">SF</abbr> bay and into the central valley every year. These performances give our musicians both a sense of accomplishment and a drive to improve. We host many dinners during the year, organized by the board for the benefit of our music programs. These fundraisers bring classic Portuguese meals to our tables, as well as some American staples. Breaking bread together reaffirms our commitment to our community.

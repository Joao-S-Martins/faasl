Our 34th anniversary was a huge success.

We're co-hosting a fundraising dinner for a 150-year-old Azorean band touring California.

They've come here from the city of Lajes on the Azorean island of Pico.
They're making several stops around California and we're proud to be sharing our hosting privelages with the PFSA council in Hayward.

We'll be perfoming a small musical introduction at 6:30, before dinner. The PFSA is providing their hall at 1105 C Street.

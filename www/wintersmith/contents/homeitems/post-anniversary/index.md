Our 34th anniversary was a huge success.

It's only with the support of such a fantastic San Leandro community that we're able to keep this organisation alive.
Keep checking this site for regular updates on how your support helps us teach the gift of music and give it back to the community.

Special thanks to the [Filarmonica Nova Artista Acoriana de Tracy](http://www.facebook.com/Novaartista "Follow Filarmonica Nova Artista Acoriana de Tracy on Facebook") for showing their support and performing for us on our special day.

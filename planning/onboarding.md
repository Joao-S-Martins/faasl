TODO insert photos for each instrument
###### Woodwinds
Most of these require wooden reeds to generate sound. They break often for beginners, so make sure to have extras at all times. These instruments have more complicated note fingerings, but are easier on the musician's face.
- Flute
    + Don't require a reed
    + Made of metal
    + Play melodies and hight accompanyments
    + Musician can transition to picolo later
- Picolo
    + Not recommended for beginners
    + Similar to a flute, but much smaller and plays much higher notes
- Clarinet (B-flat)
    + Use reeds
    + Made of wood or plastic
    + Play melodies and high accompanyments
    + Musician can transition to bass clarinet or saxophones later
- Bass Clarinet
    + Not recommended for beginners
    + Similar to B-Flat clarinet, but plays much lower notes
- Saxophones (alto or tenor)
    + Use reeds
    + Made of metal
    + Altos are smaller and play melodies
    + Tenors are larger and play low accompanyments
    + Musician can transition to to soprano or baritone saxophones later
- Saxophones (soprano or baritone)
    + Not recommended for beginners
    + Soprano plays higher notes than the alto
    + Baritone is very large and plays much lower notes than the tenor
###### Brass
These instruments rely on the musician's lips to generate sound instead of a read or striking surface. These instruments have easier note fingers, but require building more dexterity in the face. They are all made of brass and a musician can transition from one valved instrument to another fairly easily.
- Trumpet (B-flat)
    + Plays melodies and fanfares
    + Valved
- Trombone (tenor)
    + Plays low accompanyment and some melodies
    + Uses a slide instead of valves
- Euphonium (B-flat)
    + Plays low accompanyment and some melodies
    + Valved
    + Closest to tuba, making it an easier transition for musicians who wish to eventually play a tuba
- Tuba (B-flat) or Sousaphone
    + Not recommended for beginners
    + Very large and plays very low notes
    + Sousaphone is like a tuba that wraps around the musicians body for marching
###### Percussion
All the drums and cymbols fall into this category, which require a striking surface to generate sound. Students will start with the snare drum and can move to the bass drum, cymbols, or other percussion instruments as needed.
#### Equipment
- Rent or buy your instrument. You may already have one around the house of borrowed from your school that you can use. TODO specify a music shop

Fundraising can be so sweet. Filhoes, a.k.a. Portuguese donuts, go super-fast, so it is highly recommended that you pre-order ASAP. Pick-up will be on Tuesday morning, February 28th, starting at 8 AM.

They are $1 a piece and are often ordered by the dozen. Take a batch to work and you'll be voted "most popular" for a month or two. Or just horde them at home and build a sugar-coated fort, to hide from the world. Either way, you win! #faaslfilhoes

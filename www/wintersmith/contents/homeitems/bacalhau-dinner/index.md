Cod fish, salted and preserved for shipping from norther waters, is a staple of Portuguese cuisine.
Even though you can't find cod swimming off the coasts of Portugal, this fish has found a way to become the Portuguese national dish.

We'll be cooking some up by traditional means and we'd like you to join us.
Take a trip back to Portugal's golden era of shipping and find out how their taste buds fell in love with a foreign fish.

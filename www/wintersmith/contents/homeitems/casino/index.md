Join us for a day of wild shenanigans. We'll be stuffing a bus with bodies, snacks, sweets, beverages, and games.

We'll meet at FAASL HQ in the morning to enjoy coffee and other refreshments. There will be snacks and other items served peridically along the way to the casino. Once there, we'll each receive a mix of gambling and food vouchers totalling $20. After about four hours of casino fun, we'll reboard the bus and enjoy more refreshments and games headed home. Reserve your seats today! #ridethebangingbus

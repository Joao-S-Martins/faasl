####Musicians always wanted

We're always looking for more musicians to help us spread music throughout the communittee.
We perform as both a marching band and a concert band. Our pieces range from American to European styles of marches and a wider range of concert pieces.
The difficulty level can range as well, but most pieces aren't too demanding.
If you have experience but no instrument, we might be able to provide you with one.
[Contact us](contact.html "Contact Page") for more information or to ge involved.

          Just because you can't leave your house doesn't mean you can't play music. In fact, the best way to pass this time of seclusion might be to <em>play more music</em>.

          We are launching our limited Remote Restart program to help you do just that. We are scheduling one-on-one video sessions right now to help you relearn your instrument. You might only remember how to blow a few notes. You might have forgetten your scales. You might not have any sheet music to play in your house. Maybe you don't even know if your instrument works correctly.
        </p>
        <p class="col-xs-12 animate slide-up">
          We're here to help you through all of this. During these sessions, we'll field any questions you might have, help you relearn your way around your instrument, provide you with sheet music to practice, and schedule follow-up sessions as needed.

Please join us in celebrating our beloved Gary's 5th year anniversary in Eternal Life. Mass will be held on Wednesday, Jan. 6th 2016 at St. Leanders Church in San Leandro. Immediately following the mass, we are inviting everyone to join us for dinner and continue the celebration with Gary in spirit and eternal life at 857B Alvarado Street, San Leandro.

Thank you and God Bless!

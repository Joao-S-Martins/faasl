Our musicians will be performing for the San Leandro Downtown Associations's _It's a Wonderful Night_ holiday festival Friday, December 1st. We'll also be entertaining our supporters and guests at our members appreciation dinner on Saturday, December 2nd.

For these special engagements, uniforms will be left at home, but remember to dress warmly. Invite your musician friends to join us just for the fun of it.

Keep you eyes on our Facebook page for last-minute updates and announcements.<br>
